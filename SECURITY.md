I'm having problems to make the webui work, and can't find another way to contact you.
Can you please enable the 'issues' tab in this project?

Anyway, maybe you find the same problem:

```
$ yarn install
yarn install v1.22.19
[1/4] Resolving packages...
[2/4] Fetching packages...
error react-router@6.11.1: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ">=14". Got "12.22.12"
error Found incompatible module.
